# Getting started

Gathio is a simple, federated, privacy-first event hosting platform.

You can use the publicly hosted, flagship instance of Gathio at
[https://gath.io](https://gath.io), and you can also run your very own instance
on your own server.

These docs are here to:

-   Explain the more esoteric or complex features of Gathio
-   Help you set up, customize, and run Gathio on your own system

## Documentation

The docs are stored in the `docs/` folder in the Git repository and are built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).
