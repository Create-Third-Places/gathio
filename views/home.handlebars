<p class="lead">A quick and easy way to make and share events which respects your privacy.</p>

<hr>

<p>You don't need to sign up for an account. When you create an event, we generate a password which allows you to edit the event. Send all your guests the public link, and all your co-hosts the secret editing link containing the password. A week after the event finishes, it's deleted from our servers for ever, and your email goes with it.</p>

<div id="example-event" class="text-center w-100 mt-4 mb-5">
  <img alt ="An example event page for a picnic. The page shows the event's location, host, date and time, and description, as well as buttons to save the event to Google Calendar, export it, and open the location in OpenStreetMap and Google Maps." src="images/example-event-2023.png" class="img-fluid w-75 mx-auto shadow-lg rounded">
</div>

<p>Also, we don't show you ads, don't sell your data, and never send you unnecessary emails.</p>

<p>But remember: all events are visible to anyone who knows the link, so probably don't use <strong>gathio</strong> to plot your surprise birthday party or revolution. Or whatever, you do you.</p>

<h4 class="pt-2">Federation and self-hosting</h4>

<p><strong>gathio</strong> can easily be self-hosted, and supports ActivityPub services like Mastodon, Pleroma, and Friendica, allowing you to access events from anywhere on the Fediverse. We encourage you to spin up your own instance for your community. Detailed instructions on <a href="https://github.com/lowercasename/gathio/wiki/Fediverse-Instructions">ActivityPub access</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lowercasename/gathio/wiki/Installation-instructions">self-hosted installation</a> live on our GitHub wiki. Leave a question in our <a href="https://github.com/lowercasename/gathio/issues">tracker</a> if you encounter any issues.</p>
