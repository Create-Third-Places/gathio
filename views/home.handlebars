<h1>ðŸš¨Experimental Fediverse Event SoftwareðŸš¨</h1>
<p class="lead">
  This is experimental software from <a href="https://tinysubversions.com">Darius Kazemi</a>.
</p>

<hr>

<p>The Fediverse needs an event organizing system, so I've taken the incredibly lovely open source event organizing software <strong><a href="https://gath.io">gath.io</a></strong> and added my <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/express-activitypub">lightweight ActivityPub server</a> to the mix.</p>

<p>I fully expect this to break, and I would love early testers. I'm especially interested to know how this interacts with people who aren't on Mastodon.</p>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<p>Hit the green New Event button and put in your event details. Your event will have a nice looking home page and it will also have an ActivityPub-compatible account and profile. It will give you the account handle for the event, which will look something like <strong>@aB3_2HI@{{domain}}</strong> and can be shared with people on the Fediverse who want to follow your event.</p>

<p>When a person follows your event, they'll follow a feed that updates whenever you update event details. After a person follows, this software will DM the person a poll (aka an ActivityPub "Question") where, at least in Mastodon, they can vote Yes/No/Maybe. If they vote Yes, then they will be registered as an attendee on your page. No and Maybe don't do anything yet.</p>

<p>Also when you update your event (changing any of the fields), you send a DM notification to every user who is registered as attending.</p>

<h2>Further info</h2>

<p>I'll publish the source code soon, but it's in crummy and undocumented shape right now and I'd rather see it perform "in the wild" before I do an official release.</p>

<p>If you'd like to chat with me about this software, I can be reached at <a href="https://friend.camp/@darius">@darius@friend.camp</a>.</p>

<p>What follows is the documentation from <strong>gath.io</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>You don't need to sign up for an account - we just use your email to send you a secret link you can use to edit or delete your event. Send all your guests the public link, and all your co-hosts the editing link. A week after the event finishes, it's deleted from our servers for ever, and your email goes with it.</p>

<div id="example-event" class="text-center w-100 mt-4 mb-5">
  <img src="images/example-event.png" class="img-fluid w-75 mx-auto shadow-lg rounded">
</div>

<p>Also, we don't show you ads, don't sell your data, and never send you unnecessary emails.</p>

<p>But remember: all our events are visible to anyone who knows the link, so probably don't use <strong>gath<span class="text-muted">io</span></strong> to plot your surprise birthday party or revolution. Or whatever, you do you.</p>

    <p>If you find yourself using and enjoying <strong>gath<span class="text-muted">io</span></strong>, consider buying me a coffee. It'll help keep the site running! <i class="far fa-heart"></i></p>
